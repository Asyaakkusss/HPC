  ABSTRACT = {<p>We aimed to develop, train, and validate machine learning
              models for predicting preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks' gestation) in
              singleton pregnancies at different gestational intervals. Models
              were developed based on complete data from 22,603 singleton
              pregnancies from a prospective population-based cohort study that
              was conducted in 51 midwifery clinics and hospitals in Wenzhou City
              of China between 2014 and 2016. We applied Catboost, Random Forest,
              Stacked Model, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Support Vector
              Machine (SVM) algorithms, as well as logistic regression, to
              conduct feature selection and predictive modeling. Feature
              selection was implemented based on permutation-based feature
              importance lists derived from the machine learning models including
              all features, using a balanced training data set. To develop
              prediction models, the top 10%, 25%, and 50% most important
              predictive features were selected. Prediction models were developed
              with the training data set with 5-fold cross-validation for
              internal validation. Model performance was assessed using area
              under the receiver operating curve (AUC) values. The CatBoost-based
              prediction model after 26 weeks' gestation performed best with an
              AUC value of 0.70 (0.67, 0.73), accuracy of 0.81, sensitivity of
              0.47, and specificity of 0.83. Number of antenatal care visits
              before 24 weeks' gestation, aspartate aminotransferase level at
              registration, symphysis fundal height, maternal weight, abdominal
              circumference, and blood pressure emerged as strong predictors
              after 26 completed weeks. The application of machine learning on
              pregnancy surveillance data is a promising approach to predict
              preterm birth and we identified several modifiable antenatal
              predictors.</p>},

  abstract = {About one in ten babies is born preterm, i.e., before completing
              37 weeks of gestation, which can result in permanent neurologic
              deficit and is a leading cause of child mortality. Although
              imminent preterm labor can be detected, predicting preterm births
              more than one week in advance remains elusive. Here, we develop a
              deep learning method to predict preterm births directly from
              electrohysterogram (EHG) measurements of pregnant mothers recorded
              at around 31 weeks of gestation. We developed a prediction model,
              which includes a recurrent neural network, to predict preterm
              births using short-time Fourier transforms of EHG recordings and
              clinical information from two public datasets. We predicted preterm
              births with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic
              curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% confidence interval: 0.76-0.80). Moreover,
              we found that the spectral patterns of the measurements were more
              predictive than the temporal patterns, suggesting that preterm
              births can be predicted from short EHG recordings in an automated
              process. We show that preterm births can be predicted for pregnant
              mothers around their 31st week of gestation, prompting beneficial
              treatments to reduce the incidence of preterm births and improve
              their outcomes.},

  ABSTRACT = {Timely preterm labor prediction plays an important role for
              increasing the chance of neonate survival, the motherâ€™s mental
              health, and reducing financial burdens imposed on the family. The
              objective of this study is to propose a method for the reliable
              prediction of preterm labor from the electrohysterogram (EHG)
              signals based on different pregnancy weeks. In this paper, EHG
              signals recorded from 300 subjects were split into 2 groups: (I)
              those with preterm and term labor EHG data that were recorded prior
              to the 26th week of pregnancy (referred to as the PE-TE group), and
              (II) those with preterm and term labor EHG data that were recorded
              after the 26th week of pregnancy (referred to as the PL-TL group).
              After decomposing each EHG signal into four intrinsic mode
              functions (IMFs) by empirical mode decomposition (EMD), several
              linear and nonlinear features were extracted. Then, a self-adaptive
              synthetic over-sampling method was used to balance the feature
              vector for each group. Finally, a feature selection method was
              performed and the prominent ones were fed to different classifiers
              for discriminating between term and preterm labor. For both groups,
              the AdaBoost classifier achieved the best results with a mean
              accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC)
              of 95%, 92%, 97%, and 0.99 for the PE-TE group and a mean accuracy,
              sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 93%, 90%, 94%, and 0.98 for
              the PL-TL group. The similarity between the obtained results
              indicates the feasibility of the proposed method for the prediction
              of preterm labor based on different pregnancy weeks.},
